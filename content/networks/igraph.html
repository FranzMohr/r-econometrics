<p>There are multiple packages for the analysis of networks in R. This page concentrates on the <code>igraph</code> package, which allows for a broad range of applications. But before we get into it in more detail, it is useful to know that there are two possible ways to represent the <em>edges</em>, i.e. the connections, of a network:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adjacency matrix</strong>: This is a square matrix, where each row and column corresponds to an entity. If two entities are conencted, the respective field in the matrix takes the value one and zero otherwise.</li>
<li><strong>A list of connections</strong>: In its most simple form this is a list, where each edge of a network is represented by a row with one entity in the first column and the other in the second. For the purpose of this post this is our preferred representation.</li>
</ul>
<div id="create-an-artificial-graph" class="section level2">
<h2>Create an artificial graph</h2>
<p>We can illustrate these two representations by looking at an artificial network. Such a network could be generated with certain functions of the <code>igraph</code> package. However, the following code only uses base functionalities of R. It results in a data frame with the names of the connected entities in the first and second row. The third row contains a random indicator for the strength of the connection. It is based on the square of a value from a standard normal distribution. To reduce the number of resulting edges, only values above a certain threshold are kept. Also, the code excludes the connections a node has with itself.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(12345)

# Generate data
raw &lt;- data.frame(byer = rep(letters, 1, each = 26),
                  sllr = rep(letters, 26),
                  con = rnorm(26 * 26)^2) # Calculate arbitrary weights

# Drop connections with oneself
raw &lt;- raw[raw$byer != raw$sllr,]

# Only keep strong connections
raw &lt;- raw[abs(raw$con) &gt; 1,]

# Reformat row numbers
rownames(raw) &lt;- NULL

# Look at result
head(raw)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   byer sllr      con
## 1    a    f 3.304964
## 2    a    l 3.302623
## 3    a    s 1.255997
## 4    a    v 2.119310
## 5    a    x 2.412236
## 6    a    y 2.552676</code></pre>
<p>Basically, this is a list repesentation of the artifical network. In a next step we convert the data frame to an <code>igraph</code> object.</p>
</div>
<div id="igraph-objects" class="section level2">
<h2><code>igraph</code> objects</h2>
<pre class="r"><code># Load package
library(igraph)</code></pre>
<p>The transformation is straightforward and can be done with the <code>graph_from_data_frame</code> function, where for simplicity we set the argument <code>directed = FALSE</code> to indicated that the network is not directed. <em>Note that it is important that the first and second column of the data frame contain the names of the nodes that have a connection.</em></p>
<pre class="r"><code>graph_df &lt;- graph_from_data_frame(raw, directed = FALSE)</code></pre>
<p>The function <code>simplify</code> can be used to get rid of loops and multiple edges:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>graph_df &lt;- simplify(graph_df)</code></pre>
<p>Now take a look at the object:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>graph_df</code></pre>
<pre><code>## IGRAPH 2e4c8fd UN-- 26 173 -- 
## + attr: name (v/c)
## + edges from 2e4c8fd (vertex names):
##   [1] a--f a--g a--l a--m a--s a--v a--x a--y a--z b--d b--f b--g b--h b--k b--l

## + ... omitted several edges</code></pre>
<p>It does not look like the data frame list. However, it can be seen that each element of the list of edges refers to a conenction between to entities.</p>
<p>Let’s compare this list to the adjacency matrix representation. It can be obtained directly from the <code>igraph</code> object by using the <code>as_adj</code> function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>graph_adj &lt;- as_adj(graph_df)</code></pre>
<p>Now look at the first six rows and columns of the resulting object.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>graph_adj[1:6, 1:6]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 6 x 6 sparse Matrix of class &quot;dgCMatrix&quot;
##   a b c d e f
## a . . . . . 1
## b . . . 1 . 1
## c . . . . . .
## d . 1 . . 1 1
## e . . . 1 . 1
## f 1 1 . 1 1 .</code></pre>
<p>An existing connection between two nodes is indicated by the value one. If there is no connection between them, the field contains a dot. For example, the (undirected) connection between <em>a</em> and <em>f</em> is described by the 1 in the sixth value of the first column and the sixth value in the first row. This corresponds to the first entry in the list representation of the above <code>igraph</code> object. If the network were directed, only one field would contain a 1 - unless the connection was mutual.</p>
<p>Note that the resulting object is not an object of class <code>igraph</code>. <code>as_adj</code> produces a <code>dgCMatrix</code> object, which comes with the <code>Matrix</code> package and was specifically designed to implement so-called <em>sparse matrices</em>. Sparse matrices are simply matrices which contain a lot of zeros. By only considereing non-zero values, sparse matrices allow for a lot of additional computational efficiency, which is beneficial for the analysis of very large networks.</p>
<p>Now that we are familiar with the basic structure of <code>igraph</code> objects we can proceed with the calculation of basic <a href="/networks/network-summary">network summary statistics</a>.</p>
