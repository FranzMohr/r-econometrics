<p>This section is intended to get you through your undergraduate (and maybe graduate) studies in econometrics. It is based on examples from Wooldridge, J.M. (2013). Introductory econometrics: A modern approach (5<sup>th</sup>ed.). I have also reproduced the examples of the main text, which you can find in the <a href="/reproduction/wooldridge/wooldridgeintro">reproduction section of the site</a>. Alternatively, <a href="http://urfie.net/">Heiss, F. (2016) Using R for Introductory Econometrics</a> is a standalone textbook, which covers the same topics as Wooldridge (2013) and provides an introduction to R as well.</p>
