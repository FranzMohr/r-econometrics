      <description>Although heteroskedasticity does not produce biased OLS estimates, it leads to a bias in the variance-covariance matrix. This means that standard model testing methods such as t tests or F tests cannot be relied on any longer. This post provides an intuitive illustration of heteroskedasticity and covers the calculation of standard errors that are robust to it.
Data A popular illustration of heteroskedasticity is the relationship between saving and income, which is shown in the following graph.</description>

      <description>Model testing belongs to the main tasks of any econometric analysis. This post illustrates how to calculate basic test statistics such as the t statistic and the F-test in R.
Data To illustrate the calculation of test statistics in R, letâ€™s use the wage1 dataset from the wooldridge package and estimate a basic Mincer earnings function. This standard specification of earnings models explains the natural log of average hourly earnings lwage by years of education educ and experience exper.</description>
