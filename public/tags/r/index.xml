      <description>Load libraries and data Timmer et al. (2015) use 2013 vintage of world input-output database (WIOD). The following code downloads the data from the homepage, unzips it and loads it into R.
Before you download the data please note that the file has a size of about 250 MB. So make sure you have enought space on your disc before you download it.

      <title>An Introduction to Impulse Response Analysis of VAR Models</title>
      <link>https://www.r-econometrics.com/timeseries/irf/</link>

      <description>Impulse response analysis is an important step in econometric analyes, which employ vector autoregressive models. Their main purpose is to describe the evolution of a model’s variables in reaction to a shock in one or more variables. This feature allows to trace the transmission of a single shock within an otherwise noisy system of equations and, thus, makes them very useful tools in the assessment of economic policies. This post provides an introduction to the concept and interpretation of impulse response functions as they are commonly used in the VAR literature and provides code for their calculation in R.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Vector Autoregression (VAR)</title>

      <description>Since the seminal paper of Sims (1980) vector autoregressive models have become a key instrument in macroeconomic research. This post presents the basic concept of VAR analysis and guides through the estimation procedure of a simple model. When I started my undergraduate program in economics I occasionally encountered the abbreviation VAR in some macro papers. I was fascinated by those waves in the boxes titled impulse responses and wondered how difficult it would be to do such reseach on my own.</description>

      <title>Graphics with ggplot2</title>

      <description>A major challenge in data analysis is to summarise and present data with informative graphs. The ggplot2 package was specifically designed to help with this task. Since it is a very powerful and well documented package1, this introduction will only focus on its basic syntax, so that the user gets a better understanding of how to read the supporting material on the internet.
ggplot graphs are built with some kind of blocks, which usually start with the function ggplot.</description>
