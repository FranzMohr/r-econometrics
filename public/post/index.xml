      <description>This post provides a short theoretical introduction to the concept of growth accounting and uses Penn World Table data to calculate total factor productivity (TFP) growth rates for a series of countries using the simple Solow-method.
Theory Based on the growth model of Solow (1957) the discipline of growth accounting tries to assess the relative contribution of labour, capital and technology to the economic growth of a country. It departs from the idea that the economy can be described by a single production function of the form \[Y= A K^{\alpha}L^{1-\alpha,}\] which becomes \(y=Ak^{\alpha}\) in per-capita terms, where \(y = Y / L\) is output per capita, \(k = K / L\) is capital per capita and \(A\) is total factor productivity (TFP).</description>

      <description>Word or tag clouds seem to be quite popular at the moment. Although their analytical power might be limited, they do serve an aesthetic purpose and, for example, could be put on the cover page of a thesis or a presentation using the content of your work or the literature you went through.
Inspired by Andrew Collierâ€™s blog post on creating word clouds from multiple PDF-sources I played around with some texts from the Gutenberg project to visualize some of the most prominent pieces of classic literature.</description>
