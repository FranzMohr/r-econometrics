      <description>Model testing belongs to the main tasks of any econometric analysis. This post illustrates how to calculate basic test statistics such as the t-statistic and the F-test in R.
Data To illustrate the calculation of test statistics in R, letâ€™s use the wage1 dataset from the wooldridge package and estimate a basic Mincer earnings function. This standard specification of earnings models explains the natural log of average hourly earnings lwage by years of education educ and experience exper.</description>

      <description>Formulated at the beginning of the 19th century by Legendre and Gauss the method of least squares is a standard tool in econometrics to assess the relationships between different variables. This site gives a short introduction to the basic idea behind the method and describes how to estimate simple linear models with OLS in R.
The method of least squares To understand the basic idea of the method of least squares, imagine you were an astronomer at the beginning of the 19th century, who faced the challenge of combining a series of observations, which were made with imperfect instruments and at different points in time.</description>
